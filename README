A simple implementation of a spam classifier using Naive Bayes.

The classifier takes the text file 'data/SMSSpamCollection' as input, convert the label for each SMS to either 1 or 0,
split into training and test data, and then feed it into the Naive Bayes algorithm.

In order to run the classifier, make sure the SMSSpamCollection file is located in the data directory,
and then run the file spam_classifier/classifier.py
